<p> "I, being of sound mind and body, make the following pronouncements. I hereby leave the majority of my assets <strong><%="(#{current_user.will.assets_range})"%></strong> primarily to <strong><%="#{current_user.will.primary_beneficiaries}"%> </strong> and subsequently <strong><%="#{current_user.will.residuary}"%> </strong> to deal with as they see fit. I also wish that <strong><%="#{current_user.will.donation}"%></strong> receives <strong><%= current_user.will.donation_amount %></strong>% of my remaining assets"</p>
<p> "I have always strived to be the most <strong><%= "#{current_user.funeral.ten_words}" %></strong> person I could be. In the event that I have not legally declared my legal will as of the time of my passing, let this statement stand as a summation of my personal thoughts and experiences, my heartfelt intentions and my strongest desires. I hope they will offer guidance on the road ahead. </p>
