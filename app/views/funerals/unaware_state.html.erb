    <span><strong>➡️</strong> Time to get serious. 😮‍💨 There's many names used now, persistent unconcious state, vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome but they largely refer to the same thing. Would you want to be kept alive by machine? Would you offer your body to science? There's no easy way to talk about this but let's open the discussion.</span>

    <span><strong>❗</strong> Vegetative state: The person has depressed consciousness, brain stem function and can breathe without support. Patients in a vegetative state may respond to pain or loud sounds, go through sleep-wake cycles, and exhibit involuntary motions. A person in a vegetative state for more than a year is considered to be in a permanent vegetative state with extremely low chance of recovery.</span>
